Two photon spontaneous emission of an atom inside an optical cavity

This is a summary file where we have added the details of the code which is used in the manuscript "Generating
heralded high-dimensional hyper-entangled photons using Rydberg atoms". In this article, a theoretical proposal
has been presented to generate high-dimensional entangled photon source by using rubidium atom inside an
optical cavity. The rubidium atom has been excited to Rydberg state, which due to larger size or higher dipole
moment shown to have high two photon emission (TPE) rates. When such a system is placed in an optical
cavity which is tuned such that it inhibits all the first order fast processes, then the only dominant process to
decay is by emitting two photons. Later, the same system is shown also to generate polarization entanglement
which together constitute hyper-entanglement (entanglement in two pr more degrees of freedom).
In this file, we have calculated the two photon emission rates of an atom inside an optical cavity. These photons
are later showed in the reference mentioned above to be used as an heralded entangled high-dimensional photon
sources.
